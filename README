Thanks to all of the reprappers who have contributed great ideas and refinements.
Special thanks to prusajr, spacexula, makergear, kliment, shhhh, colah, Emakershop, Adrian Bowyer, Ed Sells, Rhys Jones and everybody else on IRC/thingiverse/wiki that has helped or inspired this project.

Documentation is still being organized. Below is some rough numbers and totals. This is pulled off my machine. I have yet to get it printing, so everything is still highly alpha level. 

Plan is to document here in the README, then wiki, then begin clean up/improvement of the CAD files for a version 0.3 release that might be usable.

Squaring (not even close to complete)
verticle sides = 267
top= 282
bottom side = 332
vertex to z clamp = 158
cross = 268
vertex to bar clamp for y = 37

Bill of materials (incomplete)

MDF (OK)
260mmx140mm (Lower bed, you can do elaborate cutouts, like here, https://picasaweb.google.com/tesla893/DropBox#5591547270231319026, to save weight)
260mmx230mm (Print bed)

TODO List:
